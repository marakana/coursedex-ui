          <h2>JavaScript The What You Need To Know Parts</h2>
          <p>The majority of JavaScript developers use the language "in practice" (that is, they learn on the job) but rarely go beyond a surface understanding. In this three day training class, we're going to dive pretty deep into how some of the confusing parts of the language actually work. Especially when we talk about prototypes, we'll see some perhaps surprising conclusions that change the way we think about OO in JavaScript. The goal is that you'll know why JavaScript works the way it does, so that you can make informed decisions about how to use it.</p>
